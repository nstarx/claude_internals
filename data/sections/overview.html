            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Strategic Context Management is the systematic approach to optimizing information flow, memory utilization, and cognitive resource allocation in AI-assisted development workflows. It represents the intersection of session persistence, token efficiency, and architectural understanding.</p>

                <h3>Core Concept</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition</strong>: The intelligent curation, prioritization, and persistence of project knowledge to maximize development effectiveness while minimizing cognitive and computational overhead.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Maintain <span class="badge badge-success">≥90%</span> context relevance across sessions while operating within token budgets and memory constraints.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Context Challenge</h3>

            <h4>Traditional Limitations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Token Windows</strong>: Fixed context limits (200K tokens) require strategic information selection</li>
                <li><strong>Session Amnesia</strong>: Lost context between sessions forces repeated discovery</li>
                <li><strong>Information Overload</strong>: Large codebases exceed immediate comprehension capacity</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Load</strong>: Humans and AI both struggle with excessive simultaneous context</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h4>Strategic Response</h4>
                <p>Rather than fighting these constraints, Strategic Context Management treats them as design parameters for building efficient workflows.</p>
