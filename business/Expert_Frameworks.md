## 1. Clayton Christensen 📚🔨

### Background
- Harvard Business School Professor (1952-2020)
- Pioneer of disruptive innovation theory
- Author: "The Innovator's Dilemma", "Competing Against Luck"

### Core Frameworks

#### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
**Principle**: Customers don't buy products, they "hire" them to do jobs

**Key Questions**:
- What job is the customer hiring this product to do?
- What are the functional, social, and emotional dimensions of the job?
- What are customers currently using to get the job done?
- What would cause them to "fire" current solutions?

**Application**:
- Innovation strategy
- Market segmentation (by job, not demographics)
- Competitive analysis (who else solves this job?)
- Product development priorities

#### Disruptive Innovation
**Principle**: New entrants succeed by targeting overlooked customers with "good enough" solutions

**Disruption Types**:
1. **Low-End Disruption**: Simpler, cheaper alternatives for overserved customers
2. **New-Market Disruption**: Making non-consumption into consumption

**Analytical Framework**:
- Sustaining vs. Disruptive trajectory
- Overshooting customer needs
- Asymmetric motivation (why incumbents can't respond)
- Value network analysis

**Warning Signs of Disruption**:
- "Not good enough for our customers"
- Lower margins, simpler products
- Different value network emerging
- Rapid improvement trajectory

### Communication Style
- Academic yet accessible
- Framework-driven and methodical
- Case study heavy (real company examples)
- Patient explanation of theory
- "The theory suggests that..."

### Best Used For
- Innovation strategy and R&D prioritization
- Assessing disruption risk or opportunity
- Market entry strategy
- Product-market fit analysis
- Understanding why good companies fail

#### Value Chain Analysis
**Purpose**: Identify sources of competitive advantage

**Primary Activities**: Inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing/sales, service
**Support Activities**: Procurement, technology development, HR, infrastructure

**Analysis**: Where do we create value? Where can we reduce cost? What activities are truly differentiating?

#### Generic Strategies
**Three Fundamental Strategic Positions**:
1. **Cost Leadership**: Lowest cost producer in industry
2. **Differentiation**: Unique value commanding premium price
3. **Focus**: Narrow segment with cost or differentiation advantage

**Warning**: Being "stuck in the middle" leads to poor performance

### Communication Style

### Core Frameworks

#### Purple Cow (Remarkability)
**Principle**: In a world of noise, only the remarkable gets noticed

**Key Insight**: Traditional advertising is dead; you must BE remarkable
- Boring = invisible
- Safe = risky
- Remarkable = worth talking about

**Questions**:
- Would people talk about this?
- Is this a "purple cow" in a field of brown cows?

2. **Reduce**: Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard?
3. **Raise**: Which factors should be raised well above industry standard?
4. **Create**: Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

**Output**: New value curve that diverges from industry standards

#### Strategy Canvas
**Visual Tool**: Plot value curves of your offering vs. competitors across key factors

**Analysis**:
- Where do we mimic competitors?
- Where can we diverge?
- What's our unique value curve?

#### Six Paths Framework

**Process**:
- Right people first
- Wrong people off the bus
- Right people in right seats
- THEN decide strategy

#### Confront the Brutal Facts (Stockdale Paradox)

- Scholar, statistician, former trader
- Author: "Antifragile", "The Black Swan", "Fooled by Randomness"
- Focus: Uncertainty, probability, resilience

### Core Frameworks

#### Antifragility
**Three Categories**:
1. **Fragile**: Harmed by volatility and stress
2. **Robust**: Withstands volatility
3. **Antifragile**: Benefits from volatility and stress

**Key Insight**: You can't predict black swans, but you can position to benefit from them

**Strategies**:
- Barbell strategy (extreme safety + extreme speculation, nothing in middle)
- Via negativa (removing harm rather than adding benefit)
- Optionality (asymmetric upside)

#### Black Swan Events
**Characteristics**:
1. Rare (outside normal expectations)
2. Extreme impact
3. Retrospectively predictable (narrative fallacy)

**Insight**: Traditional risk models underestimate tail risks

**Response**: Position for robustness/antifragility, not prediction

#### Skin in the Game
**Principle**: Don't trust advice from people who don't bear the consequences

**Applications**:
- Alignment of incentives
- Risk transfer vs. risk sharing
- Hidden asymmetries
- Ethical symmetry

#### Via Negativa
**Principle**: Adding by subtraction is often more powerful than addition

**Examples**:
- Health: Stop smoking > take vitamins
- Business: Remove obstacles > add features
- Strategy: Avoid ruin > optimize returns

### Communication Style
- Contrarian and provocative

### Background
- Environmental scientist, systems analyst (1941-2001)
- Author: "Thinking in Systems", "Limits to Growth"
- Pioneer of systems thinking

### Core Frameworks

#### Systems Thinking Fundamentals
**Key Concepts**:
- **Stocks**: Accumulations (money, inventory, reputation)
- **Flows**: Rates of change (revenue, production, brand building)
- **Feedback Loops**:
  - Reinforcing (amplifying, growth or decline)
  - Balancing (stabilizing, goal-seeking)

#### Twelve Leverage Points
**Where to intervene in a system (ascending order of effectiveness)**:

12. Constants, parameters (subsidies, taxes)
11. Buffer sizes (inventory, reserves)
10. Stock-and-flow structures
9. Delays (information and material flows)
8. Balancing feedback loops
7. Reinforcing feedback loops
6. Information flows
5. Rules of the system
4. Self-organization
3. Goals of the system
2. Paradigm (mindset, worldview)
1. **Transcending paradigms** (most powerful)

**Insight**: Most interventions target low-leverage points; highest leverage is changing goals and paradigms

#### System Archetypes
**Common Patterns**:
- Limits to Growth
- Shifting the Burden
- Tragedy of the Commons
- Fixes that Fail
- Escalation
- Success to the Successful

**Value**: Recognize patterns, predict dynamics, find leverage points

#### Systems Wisdom

- Resist policy resistance (system pushes back)
- Bounded rationality (everyone acts rationally in their local context)
- Delays matter (feedback comes later)

### Communication Style

- Patient with complexity
- Humble about prediction
- Focus on structure over events
- "You can't navigate well in an interconnected, feedback-dominated world unless you take your eyes off short-term events"

## 9. Jean-luc Doumont ✏️💬

### Background
- Communication consultant, scientist
- Author: "Trees, maps, and theorems"
- Focus: Effective scientific and professional communication

### Core Frameworks

#### Cognitive Load Optimization
**Principle**: Effective communication minimizes unnecessary cognitive load

**Types of Cognitive Load**:
1. **Intrinsic**: Content complexity (can't reduce)
2. **Extraneous**: Poor design (MUST reduce)
3. **Germane**: Processing and understanding (maximize)

**Goal**: Reduce extraneous load to free capacity for germane processing

#### Message-Driven Communication
**Principle**: Every communication should have a clear message, not just information

**Structure**:
- What is the ONE key takeaway?
- What supports this message?
- What can be cut?

**Test**: Can audience state your message after?

#### Trees, Maps, and Theorems
**Three Elements of Effective Communication**:

1. **Trees (Structure)**:
   - Hierarchical organization
   - Clear parent-child relationships
   - Logical flow

2. **Maps (Visualization)**:
   - Visual elements support message
   - Design enhances understanding
   - Remove decorative elements

3. **Theorems (Assertions)**:
   - Make claims, not just descriptions
   - Support claims with evidence
   - Clear conclusions

#### Audience-Centric Design
**Questions**:
- What does the audience need? (Not what do I know?)
- What is their context and background?
- What action should they take?
- How will they use this information?

#### Clarity Principles
**Guidelines**:
- One point per unit (slide, paragraph, section)
- Signal structure explicitly
- Use redundancy strategically (key points only)
- Consistency in terminology and format
- Progressive disclosure (simple → complex)

### Communication Style
- Precise and clarity-focused
- Structured and methodical
- Examples from science and business
- Meta-communication (communication about communication)
- "Optimize for your audience, not for yourself"

### Best Used For
- Presentation and pitch effectiveness
- Written communication clarity
- Executive summaries
- Strategic messaging
- Reducing miscommunication
