## Overview

The SuperClaude framework uses visual symbols for token-efficient communication while preserving clarity. This reference consolidates all symbols used across modes, MCPs, and business analysis.

**Token Savings**: 30-50% reduction when using symbols appropriately
**Readability**: Maintained at ≥95% information quality
**Context**: Symbols are self-explanatory within domain context

## Logic & Flow Symbols

### Basic Logic
| Symbol | Meaning | Usage Example |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `→` | leads to, causes, implies | User action → system response |
| `⇒` | transforms to, becomes | Raw data ⇒ processed output |
| `←` | rollback, reverse, comes from | Error ← invalid input |
| `⇄` | bidirectional, mutual | Client ⇄ server communication |
| `∴` | therefore, conclusion | Tests pass ∴ deploy |
| `∵` | because, reason | Refactor ∵ technical debt |
| `≡` | equivalent to, same as | Method A ≡ Method B (same result) |
| `≠` | not equal, different | Approach A ≠ Approach B |
| `»` | sequence, then | Load » validate » process |
| `&` | and, combine | Feature A & Feature B |
| `\|` | or, alternative, separator | Option A \| Option B |
| `:` | define, specify | Config: production mode |

### Advanced Logic
| Symbol | Meaning | Usage Example |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `∈` | member of, contained in | Component ∈ module |
| `⊂` | subset of | Feature set ⊂ MVP scope |
| `∀` | for all | ∀ users → authentication required |
| `∃` | exists, there is | ∃ bug in payment flow |
| `¬` | not, negation | ¬ authenticated → redirect |

## Symbol Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Symbols

**DO use symbols when**:
✅ Context usage >75% (token pressure)
✅ Repeating common concepts
✅ Need for visual clarity
✅ Standard domain terminology
✅ `--uc` flag is active

**DON'T use symbols when**:
❌ Context is <50% (no pressure)
❌ First mention of concept
❌ Communicating with non-technical stakeholders
❌ Symbol meaning could be ambiguous
❌ User explicitly prefers verbose output

### Symbol Combinations

**Effective patterns**:
```
→ ⇒ ∴        # Logical flow
✅ ❌ ⚠️       # Status progression
🔍 → 💡 → 🎯  # Analysis to insight to action
🏗️ → 🧪 → 📦  # Build → Test → Deploy
```

### Context Preservation

**Always maintain clarity**:
- Introduce symbols with context on first use
- Use symbols consistently throughout session
- Provide symbol key when multiple domains involved
- Fall back to words if symbol meaning unclear

## Token Efficiency Metrics

### Compression Rates

**Symbol vs. Text**:
- `→` vs "leads to" = 75% reduction
- `∴` vs "therefore" = 82% reduction
- `⚡` vs "performance" = 85% reduction
- `🎯` vs "strategic target" = 88% reduction

**Typical savings**:
- Logic symbols: 70-85% reduction
- Status symbols: 60-75% reduction
- Domain symbols: 80-90% reduction
- Business symbols: 85-95% reduction

**Overall**: 30-50% token reduction with ≥95% information quality

## Accessibility Notes

### Screen Readers
Most modern screen readers support emoji and unicode symbols. If accessibility is a concern:
- Use symbols sparingly
- Provide text alternatives in critical contexts
- Use standard punctuation for logic when possible

### Color Blindness
Status colors (🟢🟡🔴) should also have:
- Shape differences when possible
- Text labels in critical contexts
- Alternative indicators
