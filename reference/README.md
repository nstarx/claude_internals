# Quick Reference Materials

Condensed reference guides for fast lookup and decision-making.

## Available References

- **Quick_Reference.md** - One-page cheat sheet covering essential concepts
- **Command_Reference.md** - Complete slash command listing (to be created)
- **Symbol_Reference.md** - Consolidated symbol system across all modes (to be created)
- **Decision_Trees.md** - When to use what (modes, MCPs, tools) (to be created)

## Purpose

These references provide:
- **Fast lookup** - Find information quickly without loading full guides
- **Decision support** - Choose the right approach for your task
- **Memory aids** - Quick reminders of syntax and patterns
- **Onboarding** - New users can start here

## Usage Patterns

**Before starting a task:**
1. Check Decision_Trees.md for mode/MCP selection
2. Reference Quick_Reference.md for essential patterns
3. Load full documentation only if needed

**During development:**
1. Use Command_Reference.md for slash command syntax
2. Check Symbol_Reference.md for symbol meanings
3. Return to full guides for deep dives

## Token Efficiency

Reference files are designed for minimal token usage:
- Quick_Reference.md: ~5-8K tokens
- Command_Reference.md: ~3-5K tokens
- Symbol_Reference.md: ~4-6K tokens
- Decision_Trees.md: ~3-5K tokens

**Total reference load: ~15-24K tokens** (fits comfortably with working context)
