# Magic MCP Server

**Purpose**: Modern UI component generation from 21st.dev patterns and design systems

## Triggers
- UI component requests: buttons, forms, cards, layouts
- Design system keywords: /ui, /21, component library
- Frontend development: React components, Vue components
- Modern UI patterns: accessibility, responsiveness, animations
- Design token requests: colors, spacing, typography

## Choose When
- **Over manual coding**: For standard UI components with modern patterns
- **For design consistency**: When following 21st.dev or established design systems
- **For rapid prototyping**: Quick UI generation with best practices
- **For accessibility**: Components with built-in ARIA and a11y patterns
- **Not for custom design**: Highly unique or brand-specific visual requirements

## Works Best With
- **Context7**: Magic generates components → Context7 provides framework patterns
- **Sequential**: Sequential plans component architecture → Magic generates implementations
- **Playwright**: Magic creates UI → Playwright tests user interactions

## Examples
```
"create a login form with email and password" → Magic (modern form component)
"build a responsive navigation bar" → Magic (accessible nav component)
"design a card grid with hover effects" → Magic (interactive card layout)
"add a dark mode toggle button" → Magic (themed component)
"implement custom data visualization" → Manual coding (unique requirement)
```

## Claude Code Without Magic

When Magic MCP is unavailable, Claude Code uses these alternatives:

**Native UI Development**
- **Manual coding**: Write components from scratch using Read/Write/Edit
- **Pattern copying**: Copy existing components and modify with Edit
- **WebSearch**: Find UI libraries and copy patterns from documentation
- **Context7**: Look up component patterns from framework docs

**Workflow Differences**
- **Speed**: Slower manual implementation vs Magic's instant generation
- **Consistency**: Manual styling vs Magic's design system patterns
- **Accessibility**: Manual ARIA implementation vs Magic's built-in a11y
- **Best practices**: Need to research vs Magic's modern patterns

**When to use Native vs Magic**
- Native is sufficient for: Simple components, existing pattern reuse, custom designs
- Magic adds value for: Complex components, design system adherence, rapid prototyping, accessibility

## Word Dictionary

**Design system**: Comprehensive set of standards for visual design, components, and patterns

**21st.dev**: Modern design pattern library focused on contemporary UI/UX practices

**Component library**: Collection of reusable UI components with consistent styling

**Design tokens**: Named values for colors, spacing, typography used across design system

**ARIA**: Accessible Rich Internet Applications - standards for web accessibility

**a11y**: Numeronym for accessibility (a + 11 letters + y)

**Responsive design**: UI that adapts to different screen sizes and devices
