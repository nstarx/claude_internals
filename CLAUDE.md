Use only PrimeVue icons.

No left border on panels.

Do not create monolithic code: HTML, JS, Python.

Split content across different files.

This project will be deployed to GitHub Pages as an HTML site.

Render every Markdown (.md) file inside the HTML. Provide a solution for this.

Create a simulation section where users can play with the math formulas in a fun, engaging way.

Double-check all claims. Add a section that explains the formulas, numbered claims, and references.

Reading files outside this project is okay. Pause and ask before any write or delete operations.


Readability is the top priority.
